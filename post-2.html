    <p>
      The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat
      landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to China and brought to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the
      original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. The
      carefully refined, more extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes; a
      triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and various forms of point
      colouration. Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the original stock, and
      the more moderate, traditional, or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established
      by multiple registries as the Thai cat. The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as
      affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch. Siamese tend to
      seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats.

      The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other breeds developed by
      crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair, developed to
      expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation
      breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat. The Siamese cat comes in two
      distinct variations: <b>traditional</b>, with an apple-shaped head and a slightly chubby body; or <b>the modern
        Siamese</b>, which are very skinny and have a wedge-shaped head. The long-haired Siamese is recognized
      internationally as a Balinese cat. Siamese cats are one of the more common breeds to have different colored
      irises.
